== Introduction

* STUtor is for *tutor coordinators* who prefer to use a *desktop app* for _matching_ and _managing_ a large database of tutors and students.
* This app is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* If you can type fast, STUtor can get your *tutor and student management tasks done faster* than traditional GUI apps.

* Interested? Jump to the <<Getting Started>> now! Enjoy!

== Getting Started
This section helps you set up your STUtor app on your computer.

.  Ensure you have Java version __1.8.0_60__ or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest _STUtor.jar_ link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use for storing your STUtor.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. You will see the interface in a few seconds.

*  Sections of STUtor:
** Section 1: *Command Box* to type your commands
** Section 2: *Result Display* to show the results of your command
** Section 3: *Pair List* to list all pairs currently matched
** Section 4: *Person List* to list all persons in the entire database
** Section 5: *Information Panel* to show all details of a person
// end::ui[]

*  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing `*help*` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
*  Some example commands you can try:
** To list all contacts: `*list*`
** To add a contact named `John Doe` and his particulars to STUtor: `*add* n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 $/50 sub/Math lvl/Lower Sec r/Student`
** To delete the 3rd contact shown in the current list: `*delete* 3`
** To exit the app: `*exit*`
* For more details for each command, you can view <<Basic Features>>.


[[Features]]

* Items in *square brackets* are *optional*

[%hardbreak]
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be *used multiple times* including zero times

[%hardbreak]
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in *any order*

[%hardbreak]
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* For advanced users, a *shorter alias* for most commands exist to reduce typing. These are provided in the information for each command.
****

=== Basic Features

**  Upon adding to STUtor, all persons will have a default status of "Not Matched".
****

[NOTE]
====
Only the NAME field is required for the command to be accepted, all other fields are optional. +
To fill in the other fields later, you can use the edit command to edit the person with the new information. +
