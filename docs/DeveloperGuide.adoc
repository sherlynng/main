By: `Team W11-B1`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction
STUtor is a desktop application made specifically for the purpose of tuition coordinating. This guide provides information that will help you get started out with contributing to the project, such as the architecture and implementation of the available features.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to *999* to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-W11-B1/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-W11-B1/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. If you want to update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The User Interface (UI) of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Reveals its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to figure 2 below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and reveals its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below (figure 3) shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below (figure 4) shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `InfoPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the _Sequence Diagram_ (figure 8)  for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.
Such classes include the `LogsCenter` and `EventsCenter` that are used to implement the logging in the application and event-centered design respectively.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[NOTE]
You may want to find out about the approach for existing features described here before starting to code!

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:
.Logic Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

.Stack Diagram for Undo/Redo after `Delete`
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

.Stack Diagram for Undo/Redo after `Add`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

.Stack Diagram for Undo/Redo after `Undo`
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following _sequence diagram_ (figure 15) shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence Diagram for `Undo`
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. In this scenario, the `redoStack` is no longer empty. When the new command is executed, the `redoStack` will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.Stack Diagram for Undo/Redo after a new command `Clear`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.Stack Diagram for Undo/Redo after `List`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.Activity Diagram for Undo/Redo
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: It may be difficult for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::uimodifications[]

=== UI Modifications

==== Details Panel
The details panel is modified to show the selected person’s details instead of opening up a URL.
This allows better visualization of a person’s details as each person now has up to 11 attributes: `Name`, `Phone`,
`Address`, `Email`, `Role`, `Status`, `Subject`, `Level`, `Price`, `Remark`, `Rate` to be displayed.
Below shows the modifications made:

**Before**

image::OldBrowserPanel.png[width="500"]

**After**

image::NewDetailsPanel.png[width="500"]


===== Current Implementation
The UI is modified using `SceneBuilder` and the layout is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/DetailsPanel.fxml[`DetailsPanel.fxml`].
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/DetailsPanel.java[`DetailsPanel.java`] subscribes to `handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent`, where this allows the details panel to
be updated whenever the user selects on a specific person.

We choose to place the person's name at the top of the details panel for easy identification of a person while
other details are organized in a table format for easy reference. Rows of the table are also alternately colored
to increase readability.

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Layout of Details Panel

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use table to display person details with a column specifying the type of attribute
and the other specifying the actual content.
** Pros: Easy to read and refer to.
** Cons: May not look visually appealing due to grids and lines.
* **Alternative 2:** Centralized display of person details without usage of tables and reference to the type of attribute.
** Pros: More visually appealing as formatting is less rigid and squarish.
** Cons: Locating an attribute may not be easy due to lack of labelling.
// end::uimodifications[]

==== Person Card
Person card is improved to show the list of person’s details more concisely and clearly.
Below shows the improvements made:

**Before**

image::OldPersonCard.png[width="300"]

**After**

image::NewPersonCard.png[width="300"]

===== Removal of Unnecessary Information
Besides `Name`, all other details are removed from the person card. We choose to remove it as these details can
be easily viewed by selecting on the person card since the details panel now shows the full details of a person.

As such, we decided to only leave the necessary details that the user will frequently refer
to in the person card. This helps to reduce cluttering on the side panel and allows the user to be able to view a
longer list of people at one time.

===== Coloring of Tags
To allow easy identification of the category that a tag belongs to, different colors are used for different attributes
of a person. A standardized color is used for each attribute this colour is determined from the `tagType` attribute of the `Tag`.
This ensures the color will be consistent for each person and the color will be retained when the user reopens the application.

// tag::autofill[]

=== Autofill

Due to the significant amount of attributes to type in, especially when adding or editing a person, we decided to create
autofill feature to reduce the time taken to enter a person's details. Besides `add` and `edit`, commands with
definite format (i.e. `remark`, `rate`, `delete`, `select`, `unmatch`, `match`) have this feature implemented as well.

==== Current Implementation
Autofill feature is implemented in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox.java`].
When keyboard `Delete` or `Tab` is pressed, depending on the user input in the command box, the caret position
will be shifted accordingly. Below shows the workflow when `Delete` or `Tab` is pressed.

.Activity Diagram for Autofill
image::AutofillActivityDiagram.png[width="400"]

===== Find Next Field
To find the next field to shift the caret to, manipulation of `String` is used to locate the next instance of `/` in the
command box. By searching the position of the next `/`, it indicates where the next field should be entered.

.Visualization for find next field
image::AutofillAdd_Tab2.png[width="700"]

===== Delete Previous Prefix
To delete the previous prefix, the last instance of `{nbsp}{nbsp}` from the current caret position is located. Any text
between this position and the caret position is deleted to remove the desired prefix and user input (if any). The caret
then procedes to find next field to be shifted to. Below shows what happens when `Delete` is pressed when caret position is at `n/`.

.Visualization for delete previous prefix
image::AutofillAdd_Delete.png[width="700"]

==== Select index to edit
To select/highlight the index to edit, the first instance of a digit is searched from the current caret position. The index
is then highlighted by selecting the caret forward.

.Visualization for select index to edit
image::AutofillMatch.png[width="700"]

We decide to create shortcuts for even for commands that do not have lengthy inputs (e.g. `add` and `edit`) as it makes typing
command easier for our user. By highlighting the index to edit, user can simply type the index they want to edit without
manually having to shift the caret to change the index.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Keyboard key for `Delete`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `Delete` button.
** Pros: Intuitive to user.
** Cons: May lead to confusion since the original functionality of the `DELETE` button does not work now.
* **Alternative 2:** Use other keyboard keys that users typically do not use, for example `F2`.
** Pros: Will not lead to confusion of expected keyboard functionalities.
** Cons: Not intuitive for users to use as they would not expect it to be a key for delete function.

===== Aspect: Commands that can be autofilled

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Commands that have a fixed fomat can be autofilled.
** Pros: Easy to use for the user as expected behavior of the autofill feature can be predicted.
** Cons: May lead to some confusion as only selected commands can be autofilled.
* **Alternative 2:** All commands can be autofilled.
** Pros: Will not lead to confusion as to which commands can be autofilled.
** Cons: For commands that do not have a definite format (e.g. `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`), it can be confusing for the user if the app
only autofills `find` and expects the user to remember the command format. Furthermore, using command alias (e.g. `f`) requires
less typing from the user.

// end::autofill[]

// tag::attributetags[]
=== Automatic creation of tags from person attributes

==== Current implementation
Each of the attributes `Price`, `Subject`, `Level` and `Status` of a person each have a tag with the value added to the person.
This is done when user performs `add` or `edit` command.

The creation of these tags from attributes is facilitated by static methods from a class in logic, called `AttributeTagSetter`. This class contains methods to remove existing attribute tags from a person, which can be used when needing to edit or find non-attribute tags of the person.
Another method is to create the new attribute tags from provided input and return the new set of tags. This class is currently invoked from a static context, as its use currently is solely for managing the tags of a given `Person`.
When parsing and making an add or edit command, it makes use of these methods to obtain the correct attribute tags and sets them.
The sequence diagram below (figure 18) shows where the creation of these tags in the sequence of parsing an `Add` command. +

.Sequence diagram for creating attribute tags
image::AttributeTagsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Since the `Price`, `Subject`, `Level` and `Status` attributes have been parsed and checked to conform to expected values, there is no need to reparse the values when creating them as a `Tag`. +
The acceptable inputs for a `Tag` must necessarily allow all the acceptable inputs for `Price`, `Subject`, `Level`, `Status` and `Role` to prevent errors.

==== Model Implementation
The `Tag` class can support the ability to classify which attribute the tag was created from. This is done by adding an enum `AllTagsType` to the `Tag` class.
A tag can be created without being from an attribute, with just a tag name. In this case, creating a `Tag` with no provided `AllTagsType` will initialise the `tagType` to `DEFAULT`.
Otherwise, creation of the tag will require the tagType to be passed in.

This is the current `Tag` class in UML notation

.`Tag` Class
image::TagClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

This new attribute is used to implement the capability to standardize all tags created as a `Price` attribute to have the same color, all tags created as a `Subject` attribute to have the same color, and so on.
This has been implemented as a new overloaded `getTagColorStyleFor` method, which takes in a Tag instead of a String. Depending on the tagType value, the correct colour will be assigned to the tag.

[NOTE]
Any tag that is not set to one of the 4 attributes will fall through to the default type, where they will have the same color. This is currently done as such to prevent accidental collisions of color with the 4 attribute tags.

==== Storage Implementation
The method for storing tags has also been changed slightly. Previously, just the `tagName` needed to be stored. Now both the `tagName` and `tagType` must be stored. +
This has been accomplished by having XML store the single field in the form "TAGNAME,TAGTYPE" (see figure 19). +
The respective tagName and tagType can be obtained by splitting the read string representing the tag data from the file around the "," separator. Since tags can only be alphanumeric, this provides a safe character to split around.

.Storage of `Tag`
image::tagStorage.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Making use of tags to display the information
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `Tag` for each attribute we want to display
** Pros: Reuses the code used to display tags, so that there is no need to manually code each attribute to appear similar to a tag.
** Cons: Increased risk of violating Single Responsibility Principle if the `Tag` needs to change if attributes in `Person` change.

* **Alternative 2:** Update the UI to allow the information to be displayed as needed.
** Pros: Makes the logic section more intuitive as the user enters data and that data is stored a single attribute.
** Cons: Increases repetition in the UI by having a design for each attribute, increases amount of work if the UI display is changed in the future.

===== Aspect: Method of saving tag information in the saved XML file

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Keep the `XmlAdaptedTag` stored in a single XML field.
** Pros: There is no need to change the format of the XML file.
** Cons: Need to ensure that the `tagName` and `tagType` can be clearly split when saved to the XML file, and retrieved back.
* **Alternative 2:** Change the format of `XmlAdaptedTag`
** Pros: Easier for advanced users to edit without causing an error, easy to retrieve values from file.
** Cons: Risks causing issues with how `Tag` is saved as part of `XmlAdaptedPerson` and by itself as `XmlAdaptedTag`

===== Aspect: Method to represent the attribute the tag was created from

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new attribute in `Tag` to represent its type.
** Pros: Since the type belongs to and describes a `Tag`, this improves the cohesion of `Tag` and is intuitive.
** Cons: Need to make sure there is a way to represent user input tags and it is handled properly each time tag type is used.

* **Alternative 2:** Check the value in the tag against a known set of values to determine its type.
** Pros: Keeps the `Tag` class a simple as possible.
** Cons: Difficult to maintain, must ensure that there are no values that can possibly be in more than 1 person attribute.

=== Shortcuts for the user in filling fields

==== Current Implementation
Due to the nature of the application, the user will input certain information repetitively.
For example, `Role` can only be one of `Student` or `Tutor`.

Thus, we have created shortcuts to improve efficiency in filling the fields.
We currently support shortcuts for `Subject`, `Level`, and `Role`.

[width="59%",cols="<30%,<35%,<35%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Applicable field |Shortcut |Equivalence in full
|subject | `sub/chem`| `sub/chemistry`
|subject | `sub/phy`| `sub/physics`
|subject | `sub/chi`| `sub/chinese`
|subject | `sub/eng`| `sub/english`
|level | `lvl/us`| `lvl/upper sec`
|level | `lvl/ls`| `lvl/lower sec`
|level | `lvl/up`| `lvl/upper pri`
|level | `lvl/lp`| `lvl/lower pri`
|role | `r/t`| `r/tutor`
|role | `r/s`| `r/student`
|=======================================================================

==== Model Implementation
The shortcut is first validated, then the field information is converted to its full form.
Below is the function that performs conversion in the Role class. Other classes follow similar implementation.
[source,java]
----
 public String convertToFullRole(String original) {
      String cur = original.toLowerCase();
       if (cur == null) {
           return "";
        } else if (cur.equals("s")) {
            cur = "Student";
        } else if (cur.equals("t")) {
            cur = "Tutor";
        }
       return cur;
 }
----
// end::fillingshortcut[]

// tag::caseinsensitiveinput[]
=== Case-insensitive input

==== Current Implementation
We made input of fields case-insensitive.

After parsing and validation, the field entered is converted to <<proper-case, proper case>> internally, so tags generated from the field information will be standardized and more readable for the user.
The exceptions are `Price` and `Phone` as they consist only of numbers and require no case conversion.
`Email` and `Name` are kept in the same case in which they were entered.

==== Model Implementation
We utilise the `ProperCaseConverter` object to convert all parsed and valid input into proper case.
The sequence diagram below shows how this is achieved in the constructor of `Role` class.


.Sequence Diagram for achieveing case insensitive input
image::SDforCaseInsensitiveInput.png[width="800"]

The other classes utilise the `ProperCaseConverter` object in a similar way.


[NOTE]
The user can input shortcuts in case-insensitive fashion. +
For instance, the user may input `add n/jOHN dOE p/98765432 e/johND@eXaMpLe.com a/NUS #04-02 $/50 sub/PHy lvl/uP t/T`
, the stored entry will be `jOHN dOE Phone: 98765432 Email: johND@eXaMpLe.com Address: NUS #04-02 Tags: [Tutor][Upper Pri][50][Physics][Not Matched]`


// end::caseinsensitiveinput[]

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter feature

==== Current Implementation
We have added the `filter` command which inherit from `Command`. The user can `filter` according to the attributes `Subject`, `Level` and `Status` of a person.
However, the current implementation can only filter for 1 argument.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter command works:

image::FilterCommandSequenceDiagramV3.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The user must input arguments in case full fashion and it is case insensitive.
For instance, the entry `filter maTH` will work.

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Argument for Filter Command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Argument to be filtered must be typed in full fashion and it is case
insensitive.
** Pros: Incorrect case of the argument typed will still produce the intended result.
** Cons: User have to type the complete word.
* **Alternative 2:** Argument to be filtered can be incomplete and it is case insensitive.
** Pros: User can type less.
** Cons: Arguments such as `Not Matched` and `Matched` cannot be differentiated.

// end::filter[]

// tag::optionaladd[]
=== Optional Fields for Add Command
==== Current Implementation

The `Add` command is extremely long and unwieldly if the user has to type all the information in at once. +
To make it easier for the user to enter new people or a person they lack all the data to enter at once, the `Add` command allows the user to specify only the name command and leave out all other fields as optional.
The `AddCommandParser` now will only check that the `Name` field has been submitted by the user before proceeding to add the new entry into STUtor.
For all fields that the user did not enter a value for, an empty string `""` will be assigned to that field.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Method to store unentered fields

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store it as an empty string `""`
** Pros: Does not affect most of the other functionality as they will still successfully read an empty string and ignore it.
** Cons: Need to ensure that empty string is an accepted input when making a new attribute class. +
User can enter prefix with only spaces as a valid input, which will be read as an unentered field, which may be unintuitive.

* **Alternative 2:** Store it as a `null` value
** Pros: More intuitive to store a missing value as `null`.
** Cons: When an attribute value needs to be obtained or used, must check for `null` value and handle accordingly. +
Must create a special constructor for the attribute class to accept a `null` for its internal `String` value.

=== Find Missing Command
==== Current Implementation
The intention and design behind this command is to complement the allowing of users to leave fields for a person's values unentered.
As the design of the command, parser and sequence when a user enters a find missing command to be very similar to the filter command, the documentation
here will focus more on the design considerations and rationale instead of repeating sequence diagrams that are almost the same as given previously. +

Currently, the command makes use of a new predicate, `FindMissingPredicate`, to perform the check. +
The implementation of the OR search in the `FindMissingPredicate` is as follows: +
For each entered field by the user, if that field is unentered by the user, then the predicate will immediately return `true` as the person fits the criteria.
If at the end of checking all values at the list, then the person has all fields specified by the user filled. Therefore, the predicate will return `false` in this case. +

Rationale for having a new command and predicate is that reusing the `Filter` command or predicate would violate Single Responsibility Principle and the idea of Separation of Concerns.
The `Filter` command and classes associated closely to it should have the single concern of listing people according to a search term. +
Therefore, it is better design to create a new command for this feature.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Design of predicate used
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** One single predicate, containing a `List` of entered user arguments.
** Pros: Ensures the predicate used in the `FindMissingCommand` remains of type `FindMissingPredicate`. Easy to test and inspect manually and to update the command predicate if needed.
** Cons: Increased complexity of ensuring the predicate test will correctly give a true or false value.

* **Alternative 2:** Create one predicate for each user argument, then make use of `Predicate` method to perform a logical OR.
** Pros: Predicate simply needs to check for the field that was given as its keyword.
** Cons: Due to the `Predicate.or` method being provided by Java, it is difficult to debug and ensure an intended `.equals` check is performed.

===== Aspect: Method of taking in user input
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have user arguments be combined in an OR manner.
** Pros: Makes it easier for the user to find a person they may not be too sure which field was left empty for, since they can specify multiple ones to search. +
Current option used since it fits best with the user need of simply finding those with missing fields to refresh their memory on which people they need to fill out the attributes for.

* **Alternative 2:** Have user arguments be combined in an AND manner.
** Pros: Allows the user to narrow down a search, especially if the size of the stored contacts is large.
** Cons: Might be too specific for the user, if they forget exactly which fields were left empty they will not be able to find the user. +
This is the opposite of the OR choice, therefore the implementation depends on the user need.

* **Alternative 3:** Allow user to enter only 1 argument
** Pros: Simplifies the command significantly with only 1 field to search for.
** Cons: Artificially limits the command heavily for users, where those who want to search for multiple missing fields will not be able to.

// end::optionaladd[]

// tag::review[]
=== Review Feature
As a tuition coordinator may receive feedback from students or tutors regarding their lessons, this feature helps the tuition coordinator
to manage these information easily. Review feature in STUtor includes both adding a remark and rating for a student or tutor.

==== Remark Command
===== Current Implementation
There are two ways users can interact with the Remark Command:

. Create a new remark
. Edit a current remark

[NOTE]
====
By default, when a person is added into STUtor, we create an empty remark (i.e. empty string) as usually at the start, there will
be no available feedback for a particular student or tutor yet.
====

`RemarkCommandParser` is implemented such that when creating a new remark, there is no restriction to the content of a
remark. Any input indicated after the prefix `r/` will be taken to be the new remark created for the person indicated at
the specified `INDEX`. If there is no remark indicated after `r/`, it is assumed that the user wants to remove the current remark.

For editing a remark, prefix `r/` is not used to differentiate having the word 'edit' in the remark or executing edit remark command
by getting the preamble in `RemarkCommandParser`. If it is an edit remark command, overloaded constructor for `RemarkCommand`
with extra `isEditRemark` parameter is used instead of the constructor used when creating a new remark (without the extra parameter).
As editing a remark requires making changes to the command box, `EditRemarkEvent` is used to signal `CommandBox` to make the
appropriate modifications.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the remark operation works:

image::RemarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="400"]
.Sequence Diagram for `remark`

image::RemarkCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[width="400"]


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Constructor for Remark Command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Overloading constructor with extra parameter `isEditRemark`
** Pros: Allows forward/backward compatibility such that methods that used the original constructor with two parameters can still
be used since create remark command is implemented before edit remark.
** Cons: May not be easy for new developers to understand at first glance when to use which constructor.
* **Alternative 2:** Modify current constructor to take in new parameter.
** Pros: Easy for new developers to understand at first glance as there is only one constructor.
** Cons: May cause some methods and tests that uses the old constructor to break.

==== Rate Command
===== Current Implementation

Rating is from 0.0 (low rating) to 5.0 (high rating).
Regex is used to limit user input to a maximum of 1 decimal place and any number below 0.0 or above 5.0 is rejected.
Sum of all ratings is stored as a `double` inside `Rate` class and the displayed value is calculated by taking the sum
and divide it by the number of people who rated the person.

When a person is first added to STUtor, both total rate `value` and `count` is initialized to 0.
Since the person has yet to be rated, rating will be displayed as `-` in the `DetailsPanel`.

We have decided to allow two types of ratings in STUtor:

* Cumulative rating
* Absolute rating

Default will be cumulative rating as it is more natural and useful to combine all ratings given to a specific person to gauge his/her
abilities. In STUtor, `value` in `Rate` class stores the total sum of all ratings given to the person.
To display the cumulated rating, `DetailsPanel` calls `getDisplayedValue` method in `Rate` class and
cumulated rating is calculated using the total `value` and divide it by `count`.
Every time a new rate is added, `count` increases as well.

Absolute rating is also implemented for users that wants to clear all old data or wants to shortlist/blacklist a student or tutor.
`checkRateIsAbsolute` method in `ParserUtil` class is used to find out if the user requires an absolute rating by checking the last character
in the user input. When setting an absolute rating, the app resets `count` back to 1 and rate `value` is set to the value indicated by the user.

The following sequence diagrams shows how the rate operation works:

image::RateCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="400"]
.Sequence Diagram for `rate`

image::RateCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Indication for Absolute Rating

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Indicate using keyboard input `-`
** Pros: Easy and quick to access `-`.
** Cons: Not intuitive for new users that absolute rating is represented by `-`.
* **Alternative 2:** Indicate using different prefix for absolute and cumulative rating
** Pros: More intuitive for users to handle the different types of rating.
** Cons: Implementation requires more complex handling (e.g. prefix can be omitted, presence of both prefixes).

// end::review[]

// tag::viewstats[]

=== View Stats Command
As a tutor coordinator, it is important to have data of the people in the app at your fingertip.
This can be achieved by the `viewStats` command as consolidate statistical data regarding the people in the app.
With these data, user will be able to foresee issues such as insufficient tutor for a particular subject with ease.
Without this command, user will have to do manual consolidation which is inefficient. +
Currently, the statistical data are presented in the form of pie chart which improves readability. A snapshot showing
the role distribution between students and tutors is shown below.

.Snapshot of `viewStats`
image::CompleteChartSnap.png[width="500"]

==== Current Implementation

Whenever `viewStats` command is executed, a `ShowChartEvent` will be generated and posted to the `EventCenter`.
Subsequently, the `handleShowChartEvent` from `ChartPanel` will be notified as it is subscribed to the `EventCenter`.
`ChartPanel` will then generate the graph from the `ObservableList` and it will be displayed on the UI.

[NOTE]
Whenever any command which alters the information of people in the app is executed, execute the `viewStats` command to get the latest update.
Why does this work? Executing the `viewStats` command will generate new graphs obtained from the updated ObservableList.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Displaying of statistical data

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Replace the details in details panel with graph.
** Pros: Do not have to deviate from the use of command line input.
** Cons: Cannot view person detail and statistical data simultaneously.
* **Alternative 2:** Open a new window to show graph.
** Pros: Can use the app and view the statistical data simultaneously.
** Cons: Create inconvenience as user need to take additional steps to close the window.

===== Aspect: Displaying subjects data

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Represent subjects taught by tutor and subjects student wants to learn in bar chart.
** Pros: A subject with 0 tutor teaching or 0 student wanting to learn is well represented.
** Cons: If the difference between 2 subjects is too large, it might be hard to read the number from y-axis.
* **Alternative 2:** Represent subjects taught by tutor and subjects student wants to learn in pie chart.
** Pros: Even if the difference between 2 subject is large, data will still be easy to read.
** Cons: When there are multiple subjects with 0 tutor teaching or 0 student wanting to learn, the label of the subjects might overlap and it is hard to resolve.
// end::viewstats[]

// tag::matchunmatch[]
=== Match Command & Unmatch Command
A tuition coordinator needs to record which students are receiving tuition from which tutors.
Intuitively, the `match` command allows the user to pair a student with a tutor,
while the `unmatch` command removes the pair. +
The matched pairs will be saved to `UniquePairList` in model,
stored in STUtor.xml as a `XmlAdaptedPair`, and displayed on the Pair List panel (the leftmost vertical panel) for user to see.

==== Current Implementation
A matched pair is represented by a `Pair.java` object.
We use a `PairHash.java` class to help with creating, deleting and identifying a pair,
all of which are essential for the `match` and `unmatch` commands to work properly.

.Class diagram of Pair and PairHash class.
image::PairPairHashClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

The `PairHash` is derived using Java's `Objects.hash()` method.
Among the parameters, student.toString() and tutor.toString() are used instead of the actual
`Student` or `Tutor` objects. The rational for this choice will become clearer later. +

.Diagram showing associations between Person, Pair and PairHash class.
image::PairClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

As seen from the above diagram, a person (`Student` or `Tutor`) can have any number of unique `PairHash`, that is,
*a student can be paired to multiple tutors and vice versa.* +

The current implementation of `match` and `unmatch` relies on the one-to-one association between `Pair` and `PairHash`.
`PairHash` is used to facilitate matching and unmatching, as well as updating the status of a person. +

`PairHash` objects associated with a particular `Person` object is stored inside that `Person` as a list.
When a `Pair` is created through the `match` command, a `PairHash` is generated and automatically stored in the
`Pair` itself, as well as in the `Student` and `Tutor` objects involved (see below).
Similarly, when a `Pair` is removed through the `unmatch` command, its `PairHash` is extracted
and used to retrieve the `Student` and `Tutor` marked by it. This `PairHash` is then deleted from the persons.

.Activity diagram for Match Command
image::MatchActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

Now the rational for using toString() instead of the `Person` object itself is clear:
since the `Person` object stores a list of pairHashes, direct hashing with the person object will give different hashes but
essentially adding duplicates to the `UniquePairList` in model.
The toString() method only return fields that are not related to matching, therefore
prevents duplicates from being saved to the database.

[NOTE]
Whenever a `PairHash` is add to/ removed from the list, a check is done to makes sure the status
of the person remains correct. If the list is empty, that `Person` 's status will be `Not Matched`, else it will be `Matched`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Acceptance of Many-to-Many matches
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow a student to be paired to multiple tutors and vice versa.
** Pros: Realistic as as one student may take tuition for several subjects, and a tutor is likely to take a few students.
** Cons: Requires the `Person` class to store multiple `PairHash` instead of one.
Updating of status requires extra checkings to ensure correctness.
* **Alternative 2:** Only allow one-to-one matches.
** Pros: The `Person` class only need to store one `PairHash`.
** Cons: Not realistic.

===== Aspect: Creating, deleting and identifying a pair

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `PairHash` to to identify the `Pair` itself, and mark `Person` in the Pair.
Saving the `PairHash` to the `Person` when `Pair` is created, delete the same `PairHash` from `Person`
when this `Pair` is unmatched.
** Pros: Reduce coupling between `Pair` and `Person`.
** Cons: `PairHash` has a very slight chance of having collisions, which might result in errors in data.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the `Pair` directly in `Person`.
** Pros: Easy to code.
** Cons: High degree of coupling between `Pair` and `Person`.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/details/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
